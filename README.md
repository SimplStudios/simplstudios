# SimplStudios

**We don't just build apps. We build experiences that stick with you.**

SimplStudios was born from a simple belief: software should make your life better, not more complicated. Every app we create, every line of code we write, every pixel we push — it's all in service of one thing: **you**.

This isn't just a company website. This is our home. The place where we share what we're building, connect with the people who use our apps, and show the world what happens when you refuse to settle for "good enough."

## What We're About

**SimplStudy** changed the game for students everywhere. **SimplStream** is redefining how you watch. And we're just getting started.

We're a small team with big dreams and zero tolerance for mediocrity. When something sucks, we fix it. When something's missing, we build it. When everyone else zigs, we zag.

## What's Under The Hood

This site runs on some seriously powerful tech:

- **Next.js 15** with the App Router — bleeding edge, always
- **React 19** — because we don't wait for stable releases
- **TypeScript** — we like our code like we like our coffee: strongly typed
- **PostgreSQL** on Neon — our data never sleeps
- **Prisma** — because life's too short for raw SQL
- **Tailwind CSS** — pixel-perfect, every time

---

## The Experience

- **Our Apps** — Browse everything we've built, from live releases to what's cooking in beta
- **Updates Feed** — Stay in the loop with every improvement, every fix, every new feature
- **Community Board** — Talk to us. Talk to each other. We're listening.
- **Reviews** — Real feedback from real users. No BS.
- **The Vault** — If you know, you know.
